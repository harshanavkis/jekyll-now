### Who am I ?

I am a third year undergraduate student currently studying at IIT Dhanbad and majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering.

My main interests include Deep Learning with applications to Computer Vision and Robotics. I am interested in developing low-cost solutions to problems in Computer Vision such as Autopilots. I am also interested in SLAM. I believe that most solutions can be derived from biological examples within nature. If you are working in related areas, don't hesitate to reach out if you think there is an opportunity for collaboration. I would love that!!
